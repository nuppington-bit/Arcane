Wands, clothing, other items to perform magic (runes, books, crystals, etc.)

### Farming, gathering:
Active farming to get 100% XP and 100% materials, idle farming to get 10% XP and 25% materials, but can run over night for example

### Crafting:
Same as farming, but when crafting, you always get 100% of the items crafted

### Multi chars:
Multiple characters allowed per discord account and smooth, fast switching mechanisms

### World:
+ Player housing
+ Guild housing

+ Marketplace
+ Wilderness

### Discord bot:

+ Narration system

## Concept:
You can pick a guild, type of magic, class and profession.\
You can choose to play without a guild. (no guild rules to abide, but no guild benefits either)\
After you've set up your character, you can roam the world, interact with things and players.\
Gain EXP by doing things.\
Obtain modifiers through EXP. Modifiers can be sold to players.\
AO: G aims for a high level of customization.
