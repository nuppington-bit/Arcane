# Arcane

Arcane is a concept for a text-based multiplayer RPG

### Current Guilds:
+ See guilds.md

### Current types of magic: 
+ See magic.md

### Classes and professions:
WIP

### Modifiers:
Modifiers can be used to change, combine and upgrade stats of items, spells and players or even whole items and spells

### Items:
Wands, clothing, other items to perform magic (runes, books, crystals, etc.)

### Farming, gathering:
Active farming to get 100% XP and 100% materials, idle farming to get 10% XP and 25% materials, but can run over night for example

### Crafting:
Same as farming, but when crafting, you always get 100% of the items crafted

### Multi chars:
Multiple characters allowed per account with smooth, fast switching mechanisms

### World:
+ Player housing
+ Guild housing
+ Arena
+ Marketplace
+ Wilderness

### General stuff:
+ Website for character setup, inventory and spellbook
+ Commands for spells and player interactions
+ Narration system

## Concept:
+ You can pick a guild, type of magic, class and profession.
+ You can choose to play without a guild. (no guild rules to abide, but no guild benefits either)
+ After you've set up your character, you can roam the world, interact with things and players.
+ Gain EXP by doing things.
+ Obtain modifiers through EXP. Modifiers can be sold to players.
+ Arcane aims for a high level of customization.
