    "itemDescription": "Discovered in the fires of Tartarus, this unwieldy weapon was forged with an ancient forgotten metal. The cross guard is encrusted with some sort of charred crystal, and the blade's intricate designs have long been unidentifiable due to being melted. Under moonlight, letters belonging to an archaic forgotten language glow on the handle. Only one is known to exist, the rest likely either melted away or have been stashed away somewhere. Many believe it can bring its wielder to madness.",
