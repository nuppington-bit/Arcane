    "itemSubType": "Tanto Dagger",
    "itemDescription": "Cursed by dark powers beyond mortal understanding, this tanto dagger is crafted from a shadowy, otherworldly metal that seems to drink in the light around it. The hilt is adorned with twisted, demonic symbols and glowing gemstones, each one imbued with dark and forbidden powers. The blade is etched with ancient incantations that pulse with malevolent energy, and the sharp, triangular edge is capable of slicing through even the toughest armor as if it were butter. It is cursed with powerful necromantic magic, allowing it to drain the life force of its enemies and transfer it to the wielder, strengthening them with each strike. The blade is also magically bonded to its owner, ensuring that it can only be wielded by them. It is said that the Demon's Kiss has a will of its own, and that it hungers for the life force of all those it is used against."

    "itemName": "Inquisitor's Robes",
    "itemType": "Armor",
    "itemSubType": "Robe",
    "itemDescription": "The Inquisitor's Robes are a practical and unassuming set of armor that is favored by members of The Inquisitors' Guild. Made from sturdy, plain fabric, they offer minimal protection against physical attacks. However, they are imbued with powerful magic that helps to shield the wearer from harmful spells and enchantments. Despite their magical properties, the robes are not particularly durable and lack any intricate or decorative details. They are a preferred choice for those who rely on their intelligence and magical prowess in battle and do not need additional protection against physical attacks."
